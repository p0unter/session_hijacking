# **What's It For?**  

This tool demonstrates how certain malware exploits browser vulnerabilities to:  
1. Gain unauthorized access to browser configuration directories.  
2. Extract sensitive data (e.g., cookies, authentication tokens, settings).  
3. Log and exfiltrate stolen information to a remote server.  

## **Intended Purpose** 

It is designed **strictly for educational and ethical purposes**, such as:  
- Studying malware behavior and attack methodologies in controlled environments.  
- Training cybersecurity professionals to detect and mitigate real-world threats.  
- Raising awareness about data privacy risks and defensive techniques.  

### **⚠️ Critical Ethical Disclaimer**  

- **Never use this tool maliciously** to harm individuals, organizations, or systems.  
- Unauthorized access, data theft, or distribution violates laws (e.g., CFAA, GDPR) and ethical standards.  
- Use **only in isolated lab environments** with explicit consent for testing.  
- Researchers must report vulnerabilities responsibly to affected parties, not exploit them.  

### **Key Features** 
 
- **Browser Directory Scanning**: Identifies and accesses browser configuration directories (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) where cookies, settings, and session data are stored.  
- **Cookie File Extraction**: Automatically retrieves cookie files and session data (e.g., authentication tokens, browsing history) from targeted directories.  
- **Simulated Data Exfiltration**: Demonstrates how stolen data could be logged and sent to a remote server for analysis in ethical training scenarios.  
- **Plaintext Storage Risks**: Highlights vulnerabilities in how browsers store sensitive data (e.g., unencrypted cookies) to raise awareness about secure storage practices.
